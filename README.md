# Hive HDR UDAF

This is a work in progress.

This is a Hive User Defined Aggregation Function (UDAF) Plugin that uses the HDR Histogram library.
It will produce a table of data that is suitable for graphing to show the full HDR Histogram distribution of the data.

Remaining work to do

 - [x] Unit tests passing for aggregation
 - [ ] manual system tests using HiveQL syntax
 - [ ] validation on large-scale data sets
